## Gabriel Nowaskie

This github will be an eclectic mix of various interests both in physics and computer science.

### Physics Focus
- Symplectic geometry and cotangent bundle structures
- Geometric quantization and operator theory on phase space
- Classical magnetization, ergodicity, and statistical mechanics
- Hamiltonian flows and phase space dynamics
- Computational methods for plasma and solar physics

### Work
- Development of quantum mechanics on \( T^*M \) using line bundles,
  nonlinear connections, and Koopman–von Neumann formulations
- Classical counterexamples to the Bohr–van Leeuwen theorem
- Concurrent, memory-efficient pipelines for solar flare inversion
  and DEM reconstruction

### Tools
Python, Go, C++, Bash  
Scientific computing, parallelism, inversion methods, reproducible CLI/TUI tooling

### Background
B.S. Physics (Honors with Distinction and a Thesis, Summa Cum Laude), B.A. Mathematics  
Barry Goldwater Scholar
