## Gabriel Nowaskie

This github will be an eclectic mix of various interests both in physics and computer science.

**Work:**
- Symplectic geometry & cotangent bundle methods
- Geometric quantization on phase space
- Classical magnetization & ergodicity
- Hamiltonian dynamics
- Solar flare inversion & DEM reconstruction


I typically work in Python, Go, C, and scripting for CLI/TUI tooling,
machine learning, and data processing.
